## Utilizing Piezoelectric Technology to Reduce Urban Temperatures in India
### Introduction
This presentation explores energy harvesting methods, focusing on piezoelectric technology, to mitigate urban heat in Indian metropolitan areas. It delves into the significance of piezoelectric systems, their impact on temperature control, and strategies for implementation.

### Empathize
Urbanization and human activities have led to:

High energy consumption from factories, air conditioners, vehicles, etc.
Increased traffic and vehicular pollution.
These factors contribute to elevated temperatures in metropolitan cities.

### Define
To decrease higher temperatures in urban areas, it's essential to reduce thermal emissions. Major causes include:

Excess thermal emissions.
Lack of greenery and water bodies.
Role of Thermal Emission

Thermal emissions in urban environments result from various sources, such as vehicular traffic, industrial activities, and HVAC systems. These emissions significantly contribute to the urban heat island effect, where city areas experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas.

Piezoelectric Technology

## Overview of Piezoelectric Effect

The piezoelectric effect describes the ability of certain materials to generate electrical voltage when mechanical stress is applied. This phenomenon can be harnessed in various applications, such as sensors and energy harvesting systems. In urban contexts, piezoelectric materials can be embedded in roads and walkways to convert kinetic energy from pedestrian and vehicle movements into usable electrical energy, promoting sustainability and energy efficiency.

### Prototype

In India, the largest means of transport is roadways. Implementing piezoelectric technology under roads has great potential for sustainable energy generation. By installing piezoelectric ceramics and polymers beneath pavement regions or under concrete and asphalt layers, the mechanical energy from heavy vehicles can generate electric charges. More pressure results in more electricity generation.
